I'm currently on a path. Not sure where it's heading or which direction I'm going.

***  Update 11/11/2021   ***

My focus has been on Unity and game development this year. I plan to get back into web development 
soon. I'm going to keep this updated with my progression.

***    End of Update     ***

Javascript, C# (Unity), and artist tools (Blender, Adobe, etc.) are the three areas of focus. My goal is to be good at all three. I realize it's a monumental undertaking but so
far I've done some amazing things. This path I chosen is hard. I wouldn't have it any other way.
