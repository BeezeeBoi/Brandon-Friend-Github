Just for full disclosure. I'm doing this for udemy course that I bought on Black Friday.
It seemed like a decent deal.

I'm doing this as kind of a personal website for apps and things that I create to showcase
my skills as a developer.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project.
Or if you would like to hire me!
Or for whatever reason, do not hesitate to get in touch with me.
