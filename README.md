# Brandon-Friend-Github

This is my github page. Main focus on this is to change things around. Move things, try things, commit one way and change it the very next day. As of 11/30/2020
I'm very much aware that it's atrocious. I'm not too concerned with the look of it at this time in development. I want it to be right before it looks right.

I'm experimenting with different techniques. If you know of a different or better way of doing things then by all means let me know.
