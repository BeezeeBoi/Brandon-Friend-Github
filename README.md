I'm currently on a path. Not sure where it's heading or which direction I'm going. 

Javascript, C# (Unity), and artist tools (Blender, Adobe, etc.) are the three areas of focus. My goal is to be good at all three. I realize it's a monumental undertaking but so
far I've done some amazing things. This path I chosen is hard. I wouldn't have it any other way.
